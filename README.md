## 1. Requirement

Requires a CUDA-compatible GPU with more than 8GB VRAM. Tested on an RTX3090.

For GPUs with less VRAM, consider lowering the voxel numbers per block in the configuration file to accommodate.

<details>
	<summary>
		1.1 Install python (3.9+)
	</summary>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>
		1.2 Install PyTorch following the official guide from:&nbsp
	</summary>
<br />
	
https://pytorch.org/


For example, using pip:

`python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`

Currently, I use the most recent PyTorch 2.0+ (Windows) without any problem; I could also run the program using PyTorch 1.12+ years ago. I haven't tested the programs in other environments yet. If you find any compatibility issues, please let me know.

</details>

<details>
	<summary>
		1.3 Install the additional Python libraries:
	</summary>
<br />
	
`python -m pip install numpy numpy-indexed numpy_groupies commentjson laspy[lazrs] timm tqdm gpytorch`


*I find it frustrating when programmers overuse dependencies for mere convenience, rather than for functional efficiency. It's also bothersome when they focus more on showcasing their coding skills through excessive code refactorization, but are blind to practical demands and real-world challenges.

"logs/train" includes a log file and the best-trained model

"logs/app" includes a log file and the prediction of per-point classes (2: vegetation/tree, 1:ground and other points). The class will be saved into the output laz file as the extra-byte scalar field "VegCls".

</details>

You can apply the trained model to a much larger area, e.g., the landscape level as below:

## 3. Segmentation of individual tree points from ALS

There are two main steps involved: classification of tree center regions, and segmentation of the tree boundaries.


The first step uses the same SegFormer model, identical to the previous classification section

		3.1 Customize the data folder and config.json files on your own

<br />

The reference dataset (*.laz or *.las format only) should follow those in the data folder, with a specific scalar field "itc_ref" identifying the tree ID for each point, and the scalar field "VegCls" from the previous classification module (2: vegetation/tree, 1:ground and other points).

The application dataset should have the scalar field "VegCls" from the previous classification module  (2: vegetation/tree, 1:ground and other points).

	</summary>
	
<br />
	
"data" includes the result files ("*_cfd.laz") from the "prepare" step. Smooth confidence for each point of the input point cloud will be created based on the reference dataset, which will be used to guide the training process for tree center detection.

"logs/train" includes a log file and the best-trained model

"logs/app" includes a log file and the prediction of per-point classes (2:tree center, 1:others). The class will be saved into the output laz file as the extra-byte scalar field "ConfPred".

</details>

<details>
	<summary>
		3.4 Run Matlab code (itcsegPost.m):
	</summary>
	
<br />

Please customize the file path of input and output. The input will be the result laz files from "logs/app", and the default output folder is also "logs/app". The output file ends with "_segs.laz"

The cut-pursuit algorithm and laz I/O functions have been compiled into mexw64 binary files for Windows. If you're using a different operating system, you may need to recompile them.

*There's a noticeable gap in the application of cutting-edge AI techniques, which often emphasizes creating impressive 'toy' projects and engaging in superficial competitions for accuracy ranking. This focus tends to prioritize visual appeal and immediate dopamine gratification rather than addressing more substantial challenges. These include the intricate tasks of managing complex environmental data, gaining deeper insights into the physical and spiritual realms, and tackling significant societal issues.
